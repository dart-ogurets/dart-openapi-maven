= Opinionated Dart OpenAPI v3 Plugin

This plugin was originally designed for use by the OpenAPi v3 Maven Plugin, but works with the
command line generator and the Gradle plugin. it generates _excellent_ Dart code and uses Dio.

NOTE: we are currently using 5.2.1 of the OpenAPI Maven Plugin and have no plans to update until an issue that is specific to the core crops up that we cannot resolve. The OpenAPI Maven generator updates primarily because it is the only way they can release new versions of individual generators, which we think is not the right way to deal with language support.

== How to use

This tool can be used via Maven, Gradle or from the command line. There are important additional properties that
you can configure especially around support for null safety, so read on!

=== Usage in Maven

To use it, do something like this:

[source,xml]
-----
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
        <artifactId>openapi-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>6.0.1</version>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>com.bluetrainsoftware.maven</groupId>
            <artifactId>openapi-dart-generator</artifactId>
            <version>6.1</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>mr-api</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>generate</goal>
            </goals>
            <phase>generate-sources</phase>
            <configuration>
              <output>${project.basedir}</output>
              <inputSpec>${project.basedir}/target/mrapi/mr-api.yaml</inputSpec>
              <generatorName>dart2-api</generatorName>
              <enablePostProcessFile>true</enablePostProcessFile>
              <additionalProperties>
                <additionalProperty>
                  pubName=k8s_api
                </additionalProperty>
              </additionalProperties>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
-----

We use the enablePostProcessFile because if it finds a FLUTTER environment variable, it
will run dartfmt on the generated files.

=== Usage in Gradle

In Gradle, you have to make this extra library available to the buildscript, so at the top of your file before
your plugin declaration you need a section similar to:

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
	repositories {
		mavenLocal()
		mavenCentral()
	}
	dependencies {
		classpath "com.bluetrainsoftware.maven:openapi-dart-generator:5.10"
	}
}
----

from there in your openApiGenerator definitions, you specify the server format in additional properties:

[source,groovy]
----
openApiGenerate {
    generatorName = "dart2-api"
    inputSpec = openApiSpec
    outputDir = openApiOutputDir
    apiPackage = "com.your-company.api"
    modelPackage = "com.your-company.api.model"
	  additionalProperties = [
	    'key': 'value'
	  ]
    configOptions = [:]
}
----

=== Usage from the command line

Please refer to the article https://medium.com/@irinasouthwell_220/accelerate-flutter-development-with-openapi-and-dart-code-generation-1f16f8329a6a[on Medium].

Please not the versions of all the libraries have moved on since then.

==== Additional Properties

Additional properties allow you to customise how code is generated and we honour 2 of them above the normal ones.

- `pubspec-dependencies`: anything in this will be split on a command added to the dependencies section of your
generated code.
- `pubspec-dev-dependencies`: anything here will be added to the dev dependencies of your generated code.
- `nullSafe=true' and `nullSafe-array-default=true` - these two normally go together and change the minimum version
of Dart to 2.12 and generate null safe code. Using the nullSafe-array-default, it makes even arrays that are not listed
as being `required` in your OpenAPI "required" but making them always generate a default value of `[]`. This ends up
being considerably easier to use.
- `listAnyOf=false` - this will turn _off_ AnyOf support. This would be a bit weird, but you can do it if you want.
- `disableCopyWith` - if this is specified, then the copyWith functionality will be disabled. On complex OpenAPI definitions, the combinations of null safety and nested classes can cause incomplete or invalid code to be generated. We recommend disabling the generation of the copy-with code for that purpose. It is simply a convenience for coding and is not required as part of the API.

the normal ones include:

----
name: {{pubName}}
version: {{pubVersion}}
description: {{pubDescription}}
----

They are specified in the configuration above (Maven example here):

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <output>${project.basedir}</output>
  <inputSpec>${project.basedir}/target/mrapi/mr-api.yaml</inputSpec>
  <generatorName>dart2-api</generatorName>
  <enablePostProcessFile>true</enablePostProcessFile>
    <additionalProperties>
      <additionalProperty>pubName=myapi</additionalProperty>
    </additionalProperties>
</configuration>
----

See the `src/it` project for more examples.

==== Additional files

You may need to use additional files - just add them to the project or add them via a dependency. You can use the
`importMappings` section of the configuration to bring in any packages (internal or external) into the library
definition. For example

[source,xml]
----
<typeMappings>int-or-string=IntOrString</typeMappings>
<importMappings>IntOrString=./int_or_string.dart</importMappings>
----

This will note anything that has `format: int-or-string` and map this to the class IntOrString and there will be an
extra `part` import for it added to the library main. You must write this class to have the expected criteria from
the rest of the library but it does allow you to support custom types. Again, an example of this is in `src/it`.

If you use something like this instead:

[source,xml]
----
<typeMappings>int-or-string=IntOrString</typeMappings>
<importMappings>IntOrString=package:k8s-dart/int_or_string.dart</importMappings>
----

Then it will add it to the `import` section of your library allowing
you to use external libraries.

==== Using dependencies to pull in apis from other artifacts

We typically use the Dependency Plugin to copy the actual OpenAPI yaml file from a different
project - such as in this case "mr-api".

NOTE: you can also customise this using my https://github.com/ClearPointNZ/connect-java/tree/master/maven-plugins/merge-yaml-plugin[MergeYaml plugin] if you wish to merge apis together. If often do this
for testing purposes.

[source,xml]
----
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>unpack todo api</id>
            <phase>initialize</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>unpack</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <artifactItems>
                <artifactItem>
                  <groupId>io.yourapi.mr</groupId>
                  <artifactId>mr-api</artifactId>
                  <version>1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
                  <type>jar</type>
                  <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}/target/mrapi/</outputDirectory>
                </artifactItem>
              </artifactItems>
              <includes>
                **/*.yaml
              </includes>
              <overWriteReleases>true</overWriteReleases>
              <overWriteSnapshots>true</overWriteSnapshots>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
----

And we include a custom Clean plugin definition to ensure old artifacts aren't left
behind as you generate.

=== I need to do something special with the Dio layer!

The DioClientDelegate we provide can be fully overridden - in Dart all classes are also interfaces so if you wish
to do special things in the underlying "guts" of the Dio library you can easily do so. Caching is an example, one
of our users has an https://gist.github.com/Maczuga/255e822a09f8d3dd8284096e5cda3003[example]:

Ensure you include 304 as a valid return type for cached APIs.

[source,dart]
----
import 'package:dio_cache_interceptor/dio_cache_interceptor.dart';
import 'package:openapi_dart_common/openapi.dart';
import 'package:xxxx/api_delegate.dart'; // The file below

final _cacheOptions = CacheOptions(
  store: MemCacheStore(),
  hitCacheOnErrorExcept: [401, 403],
  maxStale: const Duration(days: 7),
);

class API extends ApiClient {
    API._internal() : super(basePath: "https://xxxxxx/api") {
    apiClientDelegate = CustomDioClientDelegate();
    final dioDelegate = apiClientDelegate as CustomDioClientDelegate;
    dioDelegate.client.interceptors.add(DioCacheInterceptor(options: _cacheOptions));
  }
}
----

[source,dart]
----
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:openapi_dart_common/openapi.dart';

class CustomDioClientDelegate implements DioClientDelegate {
  @override
  final Dio client;

  CustomDioClientDelegate([Dio? client]) : client = client ?? Dio();

  @override
  Future<ApiResponse> invokeAPI(
      String basePath, String path, Iterable<QueryParam> queryParams, Object? body, Options options,
      {bool passErrorsAsApiResponses = false}) async {
    final String url = basePath + path;

    // fill in query parameters
    final Map<String, String> qParams = _convertQueryParams(queryParams);

    options.responseType = ResponseType.plain;
    options.receiveDataWhenStatusError = true;

    // Dio can't cope with this in both places, it just adds them together in a stupid way
    if (options.headers != null && options.headers!['Content-Type'] != null) {
      options.contentType = options.headers!['Content-Type']?.toString();
      options.headers!.remove('Content-Type');
    }

    try {
      Response<String> response;

      if (['GET', 'HEAD', 'DELETE'].contains(options.method)) {

----
=== Testing

If you are trying to make changes to the repository, I recommend adding a new test to "SampleRunner"
with your options - you can change it to point to your own yaml OpenAPI file and it will generate the project
into `target/SampleRunner`. Also open this project (from `target/SampleRunner`) in the IDE and you will be able to
run the test and regenerate the project (just don't do a mvn clean).

If you run and debug the test in the IDE it means you can see what OpenAPI is putting in what places and see
the breakdown of the structures and tagging that is going on.

If you add something, please make sure you provide integration tests - so add the parts of the yaml that don't
otherwise work to the projects in src/it/* projects and run the `mvn verify` command. Please make sure you add tests
to the test subfolder to ensure the code is generating and working the way you want, especially if you add stuff
to the deep copy mechanism, the hash or equals mechanisms.

To test locally you can run tests by invoking this command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean verify
----

The source for the tests is located in src/k8s** folders. The generated test output will be in target/it/k8s**.

==== Changelog
- 6.1 - migrate to the *6.0.1* version of OpenAPI, move to Java 11, swap to Kotlin. This is advertised as a breaking change and has led to some classes changing their names, adding new classes which didn't exist before.
 * fields that are marked as `required` in the OpenAPI but have default values are not required in constructors (Dart fields with default values cannot be required)
 * previously `required` = non-null, now nullable = non-null, required can be null, it just means it has
   to be sent in the data. To revert to 5.x behaviour where !required = nullable, add an additional property
   of `x-use-5x-nullable=true`. For compatibility with other languages, we recommend you do not stick
   with this for long.
- 5.13 - ability to disable the copyWith generation (see above)
- 5.12 - contributed fixes for inherited types (via https://github.com/roald-di)
- 5.11 - fix date/datetime strings in queries to not be encoded. Updated to use 5.2.1 of OpenAPI. Fixed a bunch
of templating issues that arose because of it.
- 5.10 - removal of an unnecessary date/time typecast for null safety
- 5.9 - fix for null safe 2d APIs (via PiotrMitkowski)
- 5.8 - slew of different fixes for the generator from different people, particular thanks to NANASHI0X74 for sticky ones!
. 5.7 - includes fix for enums that contain spaces
- 5.5 - this is a release focused on form, multi-part uploads, file uploads and downloads and enhancing the parameters as lodged in
a couple of tickets. This release deletes unused models from Inline form models.
- 5.4 - change the equals method to use a local variable called `__other` instead of `other` as when a class had an `other`
property,  the equals would break.
- 5.3 - AnyOf support contribution by Łukasz Wiśniewski (https://github.com/vishna) and a resolution of the application/octet-stream issue
where binary data is now returned as an ApiResponse (always).
- 5.2 - this version addresses issues with complex codegen. It assumes that by default List and Map entries will be non null for
null safe support.
- 5.1 - this addresses the issues of a non-required POST body. It does not address the issue of complex tree structures of models as yet,
this will come in 5.2.
- 5.0 - is a significant departure and you will need to use the public Dart tool to migrate your code https://pub.dev/packages/openapi_migrate/versions/1.0.0
It allows the use of null safe code by adding in the extra _additionalProperty_ `nullSafe`. It will also allow you to assume (and ensure
defaults are set) null safety for all arrays that are otherwise not declared such in your OpenAPI yaml (by making them empty arrays)
by the use of `nullSafe-array-default`.

It is recommended for 5.0 that you do an intermediate step and regenerate your existing code without these null safe functions turned on,
and use the `openapi_migrate` tool on your code. Its likely you will need to run it multiple times to catch everything. When you are ready
to move your whole project to null safety, you will be able to regenerate your API with the additionalProperty flags and then do the normal
`dart migrate` process. We are doing this with our codebase over at FeatureHub (https://featurehub.io).

Another significant departure for 5.0 is that it enforces return vaulues - you cannot return a status code from an API that is not declared in
your OpenAPI.

- 4.2 - if you directly use the Type Transformers for enums, this is a breaking change. They have changed to extensions
and have been slightly remodeled based on Robert's inlining work. The whole deserialisation mechanism has changed particluarly
for lists and maps because it wasn't able to cope more than one level deep with lists and maps (issue #19). The date
format now serialises directly properly, but not in lists.
- 4.1 - support for OpenAPI v5, released 2020/12/21. Next release will support null types in Dart. Please note that
with the move to 4.1, form models are by default NOT generated, so your parameters for methods calling forms won't
work. You need to set a global property called `skipFormModels` to false. In Maven this is in the configuration

[source,xml]
----
  <globalProperties>
    <skipFormModels>false</skipFormModels>
  </globalProperties>
----

- 3.10 - support extension methods for mapping between enum names and types
- 3.9 - support for reserved words mappings in variable names
- 3.8 - non complex lists were not being compared in equals or hash functions correctly
- 3.7 - resolved an issue with inline enums - thanks to Robert of https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology
- 3.5 - resolved an issue where class level variables were being duplicated from the parent, causing equals to fail
- 3.4 - backed out some experimental features and exposed the serialization capabilities. fixed a NPE on the copyWith.
- 3.3 - introduces feedback from Jpi & Brian Janssen around making all the LocalApi serializer calls static, so `toJson()`
can be called by jsonEncode without introducing non-Dart-like complexity. Further, we introduce an experimental vendor
extension on an operation called `x-dart-rich-operationId` - this has to be another operation id, not the same as `operationId:`
as Dart cannot have two functions with different return types. It will give you the same method signature, but return the
deserialized object, the headers and the status code. It does not interfere with the existing code generation and was introduced
to allow situations where session data is being returned outside of the body. It will be documented further once accepted.
- 3.2 - introduces support for extra elements in the pubspec, import support, arbitrary part support and a fix for arrays of date times and dates
- 3.1 - introduces support for the Kubernetes API in terms of compilation along with a considerable degree of support for the
complexity of that API. It also reduces the code generated when no forms are used or forms are used but not json. It also supports
the return of non-json data by just returning the string, allowing you to decode it.
- 2.9 - support inheritance using allOf where it exists. If the model from the generator provides a parentClass we modify the
output to now support the correct code generation to support inheritance. Resolve issue around headers not being merged if passed
by user. Fix issue with form data generation where fields need to be json encoded.
- 2.8 - resolves a number of Dart Analysis issues
- 2.6/7 - add in a new copyWith() method that allows you to make deep copies of the model and replace specific parts
- 2.5 - fixed a dangling } issue from pedantic, fixed additionalProperties support for k8s api generation, added integration tests
- 2.4 - fixed an issue if no authNames were being provided, a List<dynamic> was created instead of a List<String>
- 2.3 - this is a cleanup of the move to Dio based on pedantic feedback
- 1.5 - fixed the pubspec.yaml
- 1.4 - added in serialization of outgoing data because Dart cannot serialize an enum using json.

==== Roadmap

- We intend to support the `oneOf` syntax for parameters for request and response types by using optional parameters. This
won't change method calls when you are only passing one type.
- We will wrap exceptions that have generated models
- We intend to be generating server side code for supporting Dart server side applications.
- We are considering memoization


==== Known Issues

- When you have a nullable Map type with a default value (e.g. {}), e.g. Map<String, Filter>? then the copyWith does
not function correctly because `{} as Map<String, Filter>?` is not correct and `Map<String, Filter>?.from({})` is not
valid syntax. We will need to use the Dart 2.16 functionality to create a new type for this map and then we can resolve
the issue.
- nullable: true is being removed from OpenAPI is not part of the standard form 3.1 onwards. You *can* specify a field
as being required and being nullable: true, but this generator expects that required fields are not nullable.
